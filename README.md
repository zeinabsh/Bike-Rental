Bike Rental Analysis with Power BI & SQL 📊
In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of bike rental data for 2021 & 2022 using SQL Server, and built a fully interactive dashboard with Power BI to extract actionable insights.

🔄 Data Merging & Cleaning:
Combined multiple tables using UNION.

Joined a pricing table to calculate Revenue and Profit.

⚙️ SQL Data Transformation:
Categorized hours into time periods: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.

Grouped weekdays vs. weekends.

Classified holidays, seasons, weather conditions, and rider types.
